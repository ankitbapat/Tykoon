He tried dividing her money in three plastic bags and hanging a chore chart on the refrigerator. He was also watching her "work" online to earn virtual money to buy virtual goods. Doug decided to channel his frustration into the vision to start Tykoon. His dream is that Tykoon will empower a new generation of children who grow up financially responsible, motivated, and in control of their money.</p>

                        <p>Doug has a passion for driving innovation and creating transformative business models that empower consumers.</p>

                        <p>After his experience buying a house in the mid-1990's, Doug saw a real need in the mortgage lending market for a third party to help make the mortgage process easier for consumers. He founded LendingTree.com in June 1996 and revolutionized how consumers shop for loans, and recently helped its 30 millionth customer through the mortgage process. LendingTree went public in 2000, was purchased by IAC in 2003, and spun out from IAC as a separate public company in 2008. From 2005 to 2008, Doug also served as IAC's President and COO, leading the company through a transition from a holding company to a unified operating company.</p>

                        <p>In 2010, Doug launched the LendingTree Foundation which empowers individuals in their personal financial lives through education, action and support by matching clients with personal financial coaches. He's also a former Trustee for the Darden School Foundation and a former Board member of the Bucknell Alumni Board.</p>

                        <p>In addition to LendingTree and his non-profit work, Doug helps lead other companies that are transforming the way consumers transact online. He's the Chairman of the Board of Recyclebank (recently named one of the 50 most innovative companies in the world) and is an active mentor and angel investor. In his free time, he enjoys time with his 3 daughters, is an avid runner and enjoys an occasional round of golf. Doug has also completed two ironman triathlons, and recently summited Mount Rainier.</p>

                    <label>Co-Founder & CEO</label>
                    <p>
                        <p>Mark is a proud husband and a father to two sons. After being shocked by a rather large credit card charge for online 'apps' downloaded by his sons, Mark decided he needed to build a better way to teach his kids the values of earning, saving, giving and spending money, in a way that is fun and engaging. With a common interest and shared vision, Mark teamed up with Doug Lebda to help kids and families improve their lives through an innovative digital platform.</p>

                        <p>Mark has broad experience in launching start-ups and developing new concepts in the digital interactive, payments and consumer markets. Prior to co-founding Tykoon, Mark founded Seismic Partners in 2005, a business transformation and new venture development company. He led online sales marketing and developed ecommerce strategy at Bank of America (BAC), where he drove significant growth in online customer acquisition and helped transform BAC's use of the Internet. He also advised and invested in emerging ecommerce and technology companies while at Hambrecht & Quist. He began his career at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. where he worked in the M&A and private equity groups.</p>

                        <p>Mark and his family love to spend summers in Vermont, share good meals with friends and play with their growing menagerie of dogs. When family and work aren't keeping him busy, Mark plays guitar in a band with other time starved entrepreneurs and dreams of becoming a gourmet chef.</p>

Eureka brightens up the office and entertains visiting kid user groups. More importantly, whoever comes up with a breakthrough idea gets the privilege of having Eureka sit on their desk. We are happy to have  Eureka live and work with us, but hope that she doesn't eat all of our bananas along the way.
