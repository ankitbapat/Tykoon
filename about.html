                    <label>Co-Founder/Chairman</label>
                    <p>
                        <p>The inspiration behind Tykoon came to Doug when he and his oldest daughter, Rachel, were categorizing her allowance money into three categories; saving, spending, and giving. They tried dividing her money in three plastic bags and hanging a chore chart on the refrigerator. He was also watching her "work" online to earn virtual money to buy virtual goods. Doug decided to channel his frustration into innovation, a move that marked the beginning of Tykoon. With his daughter Rachel, their dream is that Tykoon will empower a new generation of children who grow up financially responsible, motivated, and in control of their money.</p>

                        <p>Doug has a passion for driving innovation and creating transformative business models that empower consumers.</p>

                        <p>After his experience buying a house in the mid-1990's, Doug saw a real need in the mortgage lending market for a third party to help make the mortgage process easier for consumers. 
                        <br> He founded <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/" target="_blank" class="">LendingTree.com</a> in June 1996 and revolutionized how consumers shop for loans, and recently helped its 30 millionth customer through the mortgage process. LendingTree went public in 2000, was purchased by IAC in 2003, and spun out from IAC as a separate public company in 2008. From 2005 to 2008, Doug also served as IAC's President and COO, leading the company through a transition from a holding company to a unified operating company.</p>

                        <p>In 2010, Doug launched the LendingTree Foundation which empowers individuals in their personal financial lives through education, action and support by matching clients with personal financial coaches. He's also a former Trustee for the Darden School Foundation and a former Board member of the Bucknell Alumni Board.</p>

                        <p>In addition to LendingTree and his non-profit work, Doug helps lead other companies that are transforming the way consumers transact online. He's the Chairman of the Board of Recyclebank (recently named one of the 50 most innovative companies in the world) and is an active mentor and angel investor. In his free time, he enjoys time with his 3 daughters, is an avid runner and enjoys an occasional round of golf.</p>

                    <p>
                        <p>Rachel Lebda, a money-smart high school sophomore in Charlotte, NC, inherited her financial responsibility from her father, Doug Lebda.  As someone who enjoys organizing things in her free time (not a genetic trait passed from her father), Rachel urged her dad to help her with categorizing  allowance money into three buckets; spending, saving and giving.  By doing so, Rachel could visibly see how much money she had for each purpose, pulling from her experience playing online games involving virtual currency in a virtual world. From this idea, Tykoon was born.</p>

                        <p>Although Rachel originally served as Doug’s inspiration for creating Tykoon, she has since become much more involved in its transformation.  In her new collaborative role, Rachel has been instrumental in re-defining Tykoon’s mission and has provided her input on Tykoon’s design, features, usability and overall functionality - making Tykoon something she could see other kids using on a daily basis to build the foundation for responsible money management.</p>
